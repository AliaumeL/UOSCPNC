\section{The equivalence theorem}

Our main theorem is that our operational, denotational and axiomatic preorders for combined probability and nondeterminism all coincide, in the case of both angelic and demonic nondeterminism.
\begin{theorem}[Equivalence theorem] \leavevmode
\begin{enumerate} 
\item The preorders $\Basicleq^\Op_\prang$, $\Basicleq^\Den_\prang$ and $\Basicleq^\Ax_\prang$, for mixed probability and angelic nondeterminism, coincide.

\item Similarly, the preorders $\Basicleq^\Op_\prdem$, $\Basicleq^\Den_\prdem$ and $\Basicleq^\Ax_\prdem$,
for mixed probability and demonic nondeterminism, coincide.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
