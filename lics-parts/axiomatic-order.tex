\section{Axiomatically-defined preorders}

In this section, we consider a third way of defining a basic operational preorder, by axiomatising
properties of the operations in the effect signature $\Sigma$.
Since we are defining a preorder, it is appropriate for the axiomatisation to involve inequalities
specifying desired properties of the operational preorder. As the technical framework for this, we allow
Horn clause axiomatisations of inequalities between infinitary terms.  This provides a flexible general setting for
axiomatising admissible and compositional preorderd on 
$\Trees(\mathbb{N})$.
